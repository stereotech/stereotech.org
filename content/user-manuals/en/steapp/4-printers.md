## Toolbar

At the top of each printer’s state panel, a toolbar is displayed that allows to take various actions: go to the printer management panel, control the printer lights, or change the printer’s backlight color to determine it. You can also delete printers other than the local ones (marked with the *Host* icon) from the cluster.

## Adding printers to the cluster

Below the printer state panels is a button for adding a printer to the cluster. Clicking on it will display a window with available printers located in the **same local network** with this one.

## Single printer control panel

Clicking on the *Control panel>* button on the toolbar will take you to the printer management page. It includes the following elements:

- State panel
- Wizards
- Manual control

We will discuss the last two elements in more detail.

## Wizards

The Wizards panel contains step-by-step actions available for this printer. Wizards allow to perform standard operations with the printer step by step and without errors.

> The number of wizards may vary depending on the printer model

When you start a Wizard, a window will appear with instructions, an image, and the number of steps in the operation, as well as available actions. Follow the instructions to complete the operation.

## Manual control

> **Attention** Only for experienced users!

This section allows to control printer elements manually.
Available controls are divided into groups.

The first manual control is the printer axis navigation panel. Depending on the printer type, the required moving elements are displayed

The last control is a terminal that allows to send any supported command to the printer
