## Switching on your printer for the first time

When you switch on your 3D printer for the first time, STE App will display the initial setup window; click **Letâ€™s Start** and follow the step-by-step instructions

When connecting via the mobile app, your smartphone and 3D printer must be within the same local network. After scanning the network, the app will display a list of available printers

After the initial setup is complete, you will be able to work with the app

## Starting a queue for 3D printing

First, you need to upload the *GCode* file containing the print job to the internal memory of the printer using the **Upload** field on the **Storage** card (available in the web version of the app, when connecting to a 3D printer using IP address or name in the format *st-aaa.local*).

You can also connect a USB Flash drive to the USB port of the 3D printer (USB storage will be displayed on the card **USB at ST-AAA**)

> *GCode* files containing the print job must be located in the root folder of the USB drive

A job in the 3D printing queue is created by clicking the **+** button on the **Queue** card

You may select a desired print job in the *File assignment* pop-up menu. After clicking *Save*, the job will be moved to a queue for 3D printing. To send the job to the 3D printer, you need to switch the printer from *Maintenance* to *Idle*. In a few seconds the job will be sent to the 3D printer.
