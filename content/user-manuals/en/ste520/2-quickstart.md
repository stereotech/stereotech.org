Use the plier from the **accessory bag** to remove the transportation zip ties. Remove two transportation zip ties at the front top of the 5D printer on the belts.

> **Attention!** Do not damage the belts when removing the transportation zip ties

Remove the transportation zip tie fixing the build platform.

![Remove locks](/docs/ste320/quickstart/remove_locks.jpg)

Connect the first connector of the **220V power** cable to the back of the 5D printer. Plug the second connector of the **220V power cable** into a power outlet.

> **Attention!** Make sure that your network supply voltage is 220V/50 Hz Make sure that the supply network is grounded Before switching on, check whether all of the zip ties that fix the moving elements of the 5D printer have been removed

Move the power switch to the ‘ON’ position (‘I’)
