## Materials for printing with the first printblock

The first print block contains a feed tube with a Teflon insert, which makes it easier to work with a wide range of filaments.

Some characteristics of the materials used in working with Stereotech 3D printers are shown in the table below.

## Materials for printing with the second print block

The second print block contains an all - metal feed tube without a Teflon insert, which makes it possible to print with abrasive materials (filled with carbon and glass fiber), materials with a high melting point (for example, polycarbonate – PC).
