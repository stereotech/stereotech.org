3D printers Stereotech are equipped with STE App. Use it to manage 3D printers and the printing process in a **single network** via any device: a Stereotech 3D printer screen, an Android app for a smartphone or tablet, or a PC app.

To download the STE App Android app to your smartphone or tablet, follow the link on your device:

Stereotech 3D printers support collaboration in a single local network. With this feature, you can work with Stereotech 3D printers as a production cell, or organize a training class.

To connect externally to Stereotech 3D printers, you need to connect an external control device (smartphone, tablet, or PC) and 3D printers to a single local area network (LAN) using a Wi-Fi connection or an Ethernet cable.
Stereotech 3D printers support 2 options for combining into a single network:

### 1. Connecting a Stereotech 3D printer to the local network

When you first turn On your Stereotech 3D printer, it creates a WiFi hotspot. The name of this access point matches The unique name of your 3D printer. You can connect any external control device to this network. This method is useful if you don't have access to an external network connection. This method allows you to combine several Stereotech 3D printers into a single network. To do this, connect all subsequent Stereotech 3D printers to the WiFi access Point of the first 3D printer using the **second** method. **Attention!** This connection method is not recommended for permanent use.

> If possible, always use the second connection method. 2.

### Connecting to an external local area network You can configure the connection Of your Stereotech 3D printers to an external LAN using WiFi or Ethernet via network router.

To do this, run a scan of available networks in the STE App system of the Stereotech 3D printer. Next, select the desired network and enter the Wi-Fi password. After successful connection, the Stereotech 3D printer will be able to connect to the network automatically each time. If you disconnect from an external LAN, the Stereotech 3D printer will create a WiFi hotspot. The STE App system is an environment for managing the 3D printing process on Stereotech printers through a single interface that is available on multiple devices at once.

## Open the inspection window of the 3D printer.

For this, hold the handles with both hands and pull.

![quickstart 4](/docs/ste320/quickstart/remove_front.jpg)

Use the plier from the **accessory bag** to remove the transportation zip ties.

Remove two transportation zip ties at the front top of the 3D printer on the belts.

>**Attention!** Do not damage the belts when removing the transportation zip ties

Remove the transportation zip tie fixing the build platform.

![Remove locks](/docs/ste320/quickstart/remove_locks.jpg)

Connect the first connector of the **220V power cable** to the back of the 3D printer.

Plug the second connector of the **220V power cable** into a power outlet. ![Connect power](/docs/ste320/quickstart/connect_power.jpg)

>**Attention!** Make sure that your network supply voltage is 220V/50 Hz Make sure that the supply network is grounded Before switching on, check whether all of the zip ties that fix the moving elements of the 3D printer have been removed

Move the power switch to the ‘ON’ position (‘I’)
