## Print block replacement

> **Attention!** Maintenance is performed when the power cable is disconnected!

After a long period of operation, the print block may need to be replaced. There are 2 additional print blocks included in a Stereotech 3D printer set — first and second.

To replace the print block, use the material loading/unloading function in the STE App system to unload the working material.

Turn off the printer using the power switch and disconnect the power cable.

Remove the inspection window. Remove the service window by sliding it away from you.

> **Attention!** ***Careful!*** The print block and work surface may remain hot for 10 minutes after you finish. Wait for the working elements of the Stereotech 3D printer to cool down completely.

Manually move the printing head to the central position at the front panel. Next, remove the printing head front panel with both hands: one hand should slightly press the top of the front panel, the other should slide the panel up.

Disconnect the connector of the replaced print block.

Use the supplied key to loosen the 2 screws that hold the replaced print block.

Install the new print block by taking the same actions in reverse order. After replacement, you need to calibrate the working platform using the ‘Platform Calibration’ function of the STE App.

## Material clamp adjustment

If the plastic feed is uneven, you may need to adjust the material clamp.

To perform the adjustment, move the printing head to the service position — in the center of the front panel of the Stereotech 3D printer.

Remove the top of the service window. Use the key from the accessory bag to turn the adjustment screw. Clockwise twisting — increasing the hold-down, counterclockwise twisting — decreasing the hold-down. You need to ensure sufficient material clamp.

Every half turn of the screw, try to feed the material through the nozzle. Sufficient pressure is ensured if the thread at the output is uniform along the entire length and corresponds in diameter of the installed print block nozzle (by default, the diameter is 0,4 mm).
